How did using diff make it easier to fix the bug?
+ I could immediately see where the issue was
+ From hundreds of lines of code
+ Ignored everything that was the same
+ Could fix the bug quickly

How can having easy access to the entire history of the file make me more efficient?
+ Roll back
+ Waste time searching for previous versions
+ Lost previous versions
+ Do a diff on previous versions so you can see exactly what has changed over time
