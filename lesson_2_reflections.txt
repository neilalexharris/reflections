What happens when you initialise a repository?
+ adds a .git folder for meta data
+ recognises all files in repository are not committed (untracked)
+ use 'git status' to find status of repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
+ enables a collection of files to be grouped before a single commit
+ gives a 2nd chance before making the commit; can back out of staging

How can we use the staging area to ensure we have one commit per logical change?
+ add only the files that we want to commit
+ add the files that are relevant to that particular commit

When are branches helpful?
+ when you need to break out some functionality
+ test a totally different method
