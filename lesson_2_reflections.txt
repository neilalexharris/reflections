What happens when you initialise a repository?
+ adds a .git folder for meta data
+ recognises all files in repository are not committed (untracked)
+ use 'git status' to find status of repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
+ enables a collection of files to be grouped before a single commit
+ gives a 2nd chance before making the commit; can back out of staging
